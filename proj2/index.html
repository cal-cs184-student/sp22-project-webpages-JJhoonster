    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>In this project, I explored geometric modeling by implementing a mesh renderer. The first section involved building Bezier cures and surfaces using the
	de Casteljau algorithm. I personally think it's really cool how you can just take a bunch of points in space and create a mesh out of them. The second section
	involved manipulating triangle meshes represented by half-edge data structures. The half-edge data structure was super cool and really easy to use. It really
	made all the different elements of the mesh easy to keep track of and manipulate. Flipping and splitting edges in order to be able to upsample meshes was pretty 
	fun, and being able to see how upsampling smooths out different meshes step by step was great.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>Casteljau's algorithm is a method of evaluating Bezier curves that runs linear interpolation on an a set of control points until
	there is only 1 control point. My implementation lerps every consecutive pair of control points, pushes the results to a new vector, and
	returns that vector.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>
	
	<p>Casteljau's algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces by basically evaluating a bunch of 2D Bezier curves in one dimension, and then
	taking each of those evaluated points and using them as control points to evaluate more 2D Bezier curves in another dimension. My implementation
	runs the 2D algorithm for every set of control points in one dimension, then takes those evaluated points and runs the 2D algorithm again using
	them as new control points.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
	
	<p>In order to implement area-weighted vertex normals, I grabbed the Face::normal function defined in halfEdgeMesh.cpp as a base and modified
	it to compute the vertex normal. To compute the normals of the neighboring triangles, I made sure to set h to h->twin()-next() at the end of each
	loop so that it starts at the vector coming out of the vertex.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>
	
	<p>I implemented the half-edge flip operation by first listing out every single element in a pair of triangles, and then manually setting every
	element pointer post-flip following this diagram:

	<div align="middle">
		<img src="images/p4-1.png" align="middle" width="500px" />
	</div>

	<p>When I said that I manually set every element, I really do mean EVERY element. This was to prevent me from forgetting any pointer reassignments.
	I later carefully went through and deleted some extraneous assignments after I was confident it worked.

	<p>Thanks to my careful preparation and checks, I didn't have to go on a debugging journey of epic proportions. It was relatively straightforward
	to just follow the diagram.
    </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
	
	<p>The way I implemented half-edge split is very similar to how I implemented half-edge flip. However, I couldn't find a convenient diagram for split on Piazza or online,
	so I fired up trusty ole' Photoshop and made my own:

	<div align="middle">
		<img src="images/p5-1.png" align="middle" width="500px" />
	</div>
	
	<p>I'm quite proud of how crisp and clean it looks. Again, I listed out every single element present in the 4 triangles and manually set them. Since this was a little more
	complicated than half-edge flip due to the increase in the number of elements, I only deleted a few extraneous assignments that I was sure wouldn't break anything with their
	absence.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
	
	<p>I implemented Loop subdivision by pretty much just following the commented steps in the code skeleton. I first computed new positions for all the old vertices using
	the Loop subdivision rule and equations outlined in the spec. I did forget to increment n initially, which led to this pretty cool bug:
    </p>
	
	<div align="middle">
		<img src="images/p6-1.PNG" align="middle" width="500px" />
		<figcaption align="middle">The result when you don't increment n when calculating new vertex positions</figcaption>
	</div>
	
	<p>Computing the updated vertex positions associated with edges was a rather straightforward plug-in equation. I was initially concerned that my arbitrary assignment
	of half-edges to edges in my splitEdge implementation would screw up the numbers for A/B/C/D, but then I realized that it literally didn't matter. Splitting every existing edge
	in the mesh just entailed iterating through the edges and setting new vertex positions. I made sure to keep track of how many old edges there were while iterating through the 
	previous step, so knowing when to stop wasn't an issue. It was also at this point that I went back into the splitEdge function and set isNew flags manually, since I thought it would be
	easier that way. I then flipped any new edge that connects an old and new vertex. Then I actually set the final vertex positions.

	<p>As you can see, the sharp corners are much more defined. It retains more of its original shape.

	<p>The original cube becomes slightly asymmetric after repeated subdivisions because the triangles in the mesh aren't symmetric to begin with. We can simply flip the edges
	on the face of the cube so that the triangles are symmetric to make the cube subdivide symmetrically.
